    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Finish off your night in New Orleans with some delicious, fluffy beignets! These doughy desserts are simply deep fried squares (or mouse heads, if you find yourself in Disneyland) that are topped with powedered or confectioner's sugar. Beignets are best served hot and fresh, paired with a cup of coffee or cafe au lait. They're the perfect way to end your Tour d'Orleans!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="beignets">
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups warm water</li>
            <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 and 1/4 tsp active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup evaporated milk</li>
            <li>2 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>7 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>5 tbsp unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>4 cups peanut oil, for deep frying</li>
            <li>2 cups confectioner's sugar</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, add warm water, sugar, and yeast, whisking to combine. Set aside for 10 minutes, or until the mixture has bubbled up and turned foamy.</li>
            <li>In a stand mixer bowl fitted with a paddle attachment, beat eggs until smooth. Add in vanilla and evaporated milk. Beat in 3 and 1/2 cups of flour until smooth. Turn the mixer to low and slowly add in the yeast mixture, beating until smooth. Add in butter and beat until incorporated. Bean in the remaining flour and salt. Beat until the dough is smooth and cohesive, 2 minutes. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, up to 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Line a large-rimmed baking sheet with three layers of paper towels, then set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large cast-iron pan, heart 4-inches of oil to 360 degrees (F). Remove the dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 1/4-inch thick rectangle. Cut the dough into 2 and 1/2-inch squares.</li>
            <li>In batches, fry the dough until they puff up and are golden brown, about 1 minute. With a slotted spoon, transfer the beignets to the prepared baking sheet and repeat with remaining dough.</li>
            <li>Dust with powdered sugar and serve. Enjoy!</li>
